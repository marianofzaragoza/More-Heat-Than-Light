* use live sync for timing video interruption
  * is the beat count the same on all machines???? check in aalink
  * interruption state machine
    - both nodes timestamp beats (keep track of last 2 beat timestamps)
    - 1 node sends interrupt message (after checking both temperatures) (with a proposal to start playing on beat # (2 beats in future))
    - both nodes start loading video
    - video starts playing on 2nd next full beat (based on message timestamp??) ( so there is always enough time)

* DONE time sync protocol (ntp or ptp)
* sync communnication on ableton live sync
* logfile to recreate the printout (avideo#, bvideo#, atemp, btemp, state )
* triggering scenes in ableton
* logging / graphing temperatures and videos
* weird resolution / aspect ratio
