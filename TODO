* video play related to temperature
* video sync
* multicast protocol
* sound player
* reliability / boot
* network
* printer charly
* logging (temperatures)
* remote control
* 2 thermometers on 1-wire bus
* testing with actual videos
* config file
* lightbox (only send)
* plymouth-reboot splash screen

* use live sync for timing video interruption
  - make sure video is ready to play
  - start playing on beat
  * interruption
    - both nodes timestamp beats (keep track of last 2 beat timestamps)
    - 1 node sends interrupt message (after checking both temperatures)
    - both nodes start loading video
    - video starts playing on 2nd next full beat (based on message timestamp??) ( so there is always enough time)

* time sync protocol (ntp or ptp)
* sync communnication on ableton live sync
* logfile to recreate the printout (avideo#, bvideo#, atemp, btemp, state )
