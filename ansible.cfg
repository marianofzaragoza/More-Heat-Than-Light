# "%(directory)s/ansible-ssh-%%h-%%p-%%r", however on some systems with
# very long hostnames or very long path names (caused by long user names or 
# deeply nested home directories) this can exceed the character limit on
# file socket names (108 characters for most platforms). In that case, you 
# may wish to shorten the string below.

# Example: 
# control_path = %(directory)s/%%h-%%r

# execute a module on the remote server. This can result in a significant

# By default, this option is disabled to preserve compatibility with
